# Therapy episodes and therapy combinations

The two ways `Ramses` links prescriptions into episodes and combinations are:

- by default, using the `load_medications()` function
- on request, by calling the `create_therapy_episodes()` function.

Both functions include a `transitive_closure_controls` argument, which controls parameters for linking prescriptions together into episodes and/or combinations, based on patterns of overlap or time elapsed between prescriptions (see defaults in the table below). 

To change the default settings, consult the documentation `?transitive_closure_control`.


Table: Prescription overlap pattern classification rules and default parameters

 Category | Pattern	| Conditions for <br> combination therapy |	Conditions for <br> continuation of therapy* |
 :-: | :-----: | --------- | --------- | 
 **1** | ![Overlap pattern 1](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-1.svg) | Ordered a max of 6h apart AND administrations separated by at the most 24h | Separated by at the most 36h  |
 **2** | ![Overlap pattern 2](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-2.svg) | Ordered a max of 6h apart AND drug is identical AND first administrations separated by at the most 24h | Separated by at the most 36h  |
 **3** | ![Overlap pattern 3](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-3.svg) | Never | Separated by at the most 36h |
 **4** | ![Overlap pattern 4](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-4.svg) | Never | Always |
 **5** | ![Overlap pattern 5](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-5.svg) | Ordered a max of 6h apart AND first administrations separated by at the most 24h | Always, unless combinations |
 **6** | ![Overlap pattern 6](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-6.svg) | Ordered a max of 6h apart AND first administrations separated by at the most 24h | Always, unless combinations |
 **7** | ![Overlap pattern 7](antimicrobial_therapy_episodes/cat-7.svg) | Never | Separated by at the most 36h |

*Notes:* 

- ○ denote prescriptions for one-off administrations
- ▭ denote regular prescriptions (including drugs to take home)
- $*$ for continuation edges, only monotherapy prescriptions and the first prescriptions within combinations (by drug alphabetical order) are used
- in all categories, the date of first administration of (A) is anterior or equal to the date of first administration of (B).
